"""What the pages show, read from the mirror and nowhere else.

The budget rule, absolute: no function here may open the Book or call
GeeLark. A page load renders the last pass's mirror - an idle pass already
costs ~21 Sheets reads against a 60/min quota, and a status page that syncs
is a status page that takes the service down when somebody refreshes it.
Everything below is one short Postgres connection against tables `shadow`
refreshed within the last thirty seconds.

`owner_id` is the visibility scope: None means "sees all"; a user whose
`sees` is `own` passes their id and every query narrows itself. The
narrowing lives HERE, beside the SQL, so a page cannot forget it.
